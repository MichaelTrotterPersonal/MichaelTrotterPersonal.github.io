      <h4>UAV Snow Depth Measurement</h4>

        <p>In 2016 Mick completed a masters study into the use of small UAVs in the measurement of micro-scale
          variations in snow depth.</p>
        <p>Over 6 months of field work, 5 flights were undertaken including two proof-of-concept flights at parklands
          in Melbourne,
          a late-autum, mid-winter, and early spring flights at Mt. Hotham. </p>
        <p>This work required the consultation and negotiated approval of the Mt.Hotham Resort Management Board and
          Hotham Ski Lift Company.
          As well as the safe operation alongside other airspace users including the Mt.Hotham-Falls Creek Heli-link.

        <p>The succes of this project validated the use of small UAVs and photogrammetric modelling in the measurement
          of snow depth in the Australian alpine environment. </p>
        <p>The RMS error of 0.07m that was measured during these trials was found to be sufficient for this technique
          to have commercial applications in winter ski area management.</p>

        <p>From 2016 to 2017 Mick was involved in heritage documentation projects capturing significant sights in
          Victroia with Trimble and Faro laser scanners and eBee UAVs. </p>
        <p>These sights included Cheviot Railway Tunnel, now a part of the Great Victorian Rail Trail, in central
          Victoria; the Jacka Boulevard Vaults on the St Kilda Esplenade, Melbourne;
          and Dights Mill in Abbotsford, Melbourne. </p>

        <p>In addition to heritage documentation, Mick has undertaken more than a dozen terrestrial laser scans for
          engineering and environmental customers. As well as UAV surveys for mining,
          agriculture, ski area management, water management, and major infrastructure projects. </p>
        <p>From 2016 to 2017 while working for UPG Solutions Mick was the primary point of support and expertise for
          senseFly (now AgEagle) eBee survey UAVs for Australia and New Zealand.</p>
