  <h1><b> My assignment.html page for linking to assignment items described in Assignment and Report Specifications</b>
  </h1>
  <p><br></p>
  <p>This page is the marking guide to your website that your tutor will use to find your elements. Do not name this
    page anything other than assignment.html (all lower case) or else we may not be able to find and mark your
    assignment elements.<span>&nbsp; </span>How to use this page:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>upload this assignment.html file in your website directory during part 2.3 of Lab 1</li>
    <li>later, link this page to your website's index.html page</li>
    <li>over time, link each assignment task listed below to its location in your website as soon as you have started it
    </li>
    <li>replace the "notes" paragraph with your notes or
      delete if you have no notes - your notes will help us understand and
      mark your site so you should explain things. Maybe you did a task
      differently from the way we specified it, either because your way is
      better (tell us) or minimally or not at all to fit in with your site's
      look and feel (tell us) or ... (also tell us). So, for example, a video
      might spoil the look and feel. What you do is make one anyway, link to
      it from this assessment.html page and explain in the <i>Notes</i> why
      it's not linked to from your public version of your web site. You can
      style this page as your like, so long as you keep the links to the
      assignment tasks.</li>
    <li>provide details for your best student forums posts where indicated</li>
    <li>provide the date you attended the continuous improvement session where indicated</li>
    <li>provide link to report where indicated</li>
    <li>delete these instructions when you are ready</li>
  </ul>
  <p><br></p>

  <h1><b>2.0 Part 2 Tasks</b></h1>

  <h2><b>2.1 Image Map</b></h2>
  <a href="betterskimaps.html">Better Ski Maps</a>
  <p>Notes: See the imagemap on left of this page. It should hopefully be clear, but click on the ski resort
    names/logos.</p>

  <h2><b>2.2 Photo Gallery</b></h2>
  <a href="gallery.html">Image gallery</a>
  <p>Notes: I realise some of these images, though with descriptions, dont yet tie in well with the website content.
    This will be fixed.</p>

  <h2><b>2.3 Javascript addition</b></h2>
  <a href="gallery.html">Image gallery</a>
  <p>Also see:<br>
    <a href="betterskimaps.html">Better Ski Maps</a>
  </p>
  <p>Notes: the scrolling and image display in the gallery is implemented in JavaScript. <br>
    JavaScript is used to change the source of the Better Ski Map content which then calls a web app I have deployed
    with Google Cloud Engine.<br><br>
    If you can only mark one, please mark the image gallery as it is a better demonstration of effective JavaScript
    usage.<br>
    However, quite a bit of work went into deploying the Better Ski Maps web app. Though I appreciate this doesn't shine
    through in the JavaScript which the marking probably needs to be based on.</p>

  <h2><b>2.4 Well written Javascript</b></h2>

  <h1><b>3.0 Part 3 Tasks</b></h1>

  <h2><b>3.1 Reflections</b></h2>
  <a href="about.html">About my site</a>
  <p>Notes: -</p>

  <h2><b>3.2 Alternative CSS</b></h2>
  <a href="css/bad.css">BadCSS</a>
  <p>You can also view an embeded version of this .css file in miscellania:</p>
  <a href="miscellania.html#badembed">BadCSS embeded in miscellania.html</a>
  <p>Notes: To see the effects of the bad.css, almost all of my pages (not this one) have a 'BadCSS' link in the bottom-right on the footer.
     Simply click that link and a JavaScript function will be called to switch the applied css on that page. Note that reloading or navigating to another 
     page will undo the changes and reapply the default index.css.</p>

  <h2><b>3.3 Social Networking Button(s)</b></h2>

  <a href="index.html#socials">index.html#socials</a>
  <p>Notes: I desperately wanted to include a LinkedIn badge here, but there is a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67828898/javascript-destroys-css-font-style-linkedin-badge">documented bug</a> with their badges that causes them to invalidate applied CSS. I spent half a day on this and gave up in the end...</p>

  <h2><b>3.4 Social Networking Feed(s)</b></h2>
  <a href="aviation.html#strava">aviation.html#strava</a>
  <a href="aviation.html#twitter">aviation.html#twitter</a>
  <p>Notes: Twitter feed is not mine, but the content is relevant for anyone interested in aviation. Strava feed is mine, though an alternate account made for this assignment that I've added my activities to.</p>

  <h2><b>3.5 CSS and HTML Validation</b></h2>
  <a href="images/w3c/">w3c validation screenshots folder</a><br>
  <p>Notes: I have validated all the html for this assignment, and both css pages. Almost all the html pages have links to their relevant w3c validation results screenshot image. These can be found on the footer, bottom-right of page.</p>

  <h2><b>3.6 Something Original</b></h2>
  <a href="xwind.html">Runway crosswind and daylight hours calculator</a><br>
  <p>Notes: I've implemented this runway crosswind calculator in JavaScript. It takes:<p>
    <ul>
      <li>One or multiple runway numbers (01 to 36, representing the bearing of the runway rounded to the nearest 10 degrees)</li>
      <li>A wind direction (in degrees)</li>
      <li>A wind speed (any unit) </li>
    </ul>
      It will plot the wind and runways, then calculate the best runway (least crosswind) and display the headwind and crosswind components of the wind. <br>
      It will also request the user's location, which it sends to a sunset/sunrise API to determine the local times for daylight flying. <br>
      NOTE: I've discovered that the location functionality probably doesn't work on partch so you may not get the prompt and may only see a 'location needed' message. However, the bulk of the functionality is fine. </p>
      <p>It should hopefully be simple enough for anyone to use, though it does assume some aviation knowledge in the format of runway numbers.</p>
  You can also see a screen capture and brief description of the tool here: <a href="computing.html#xwind">computing.html#xwind</a>.
