                <p><a href="xwind.html">This crosswind and daylight flying times calculator</a> was created for my
                    'something original' part of COMP6780 Assignment 3.</p>
                <p>The calculator is implemented entirely in JavaScript and performs two functions: providing the user
                    with earliest/latest daylight flying times, and doing runway selection and crosswind calculations.
                </p>
                <p>On loading, it will prompt to use your location. It uses this to form a GET request which it sends to
                    a <a href="https://sunrise-sunset.org/api">sunrise/sunset API</a>. It then parses the results for
                    start/end of civil twilight at your location,
                    converts from UTC to local time, and reports these as the first/last light. These times are of
                    significance as they mark the start/end of daytime visual flight rules based on CASA regulations.
                </p>
                <p>It also accepts user inputs for runways, wind direction, and wind speed. As these are provided it
                    plots the inputs, selects the best runway with the minimum cross-wind, and calculates the crosswind
                    and headwind components.

                <p>Have you ever gone to a ski resort you weren't familiar with and sat staring at the list of lift
                    statuses and the trail map side-by-side trying to figure out which areas were open and which
                    weren't?</p>
                <p>When Mick moved to Canberra in 2017 he found himself frustrated that Perisher didn't display their
                    lift status reports on top of their trail map, so he wrote a Python script to solve that problem and
                    has now deployed it as a web app.</p>
                <p>The app scrapes the <a href="https://www.perisher.com.au/reports-cams/reports/lift-report">Perisher
                        lift status page</a> and colour-codes each status onto <a

                        trail map.</a>

                <p><a href="https://www.liveatc.net/">LiveATC</a> is an online repository of Air Traffic Control and
                    pilot radio broadcast recordings.</p>
                <p>LiveATC is an incredible asset for anyone learning to fly or just interested in aviation. However, it
                    is also full of large periods of silence.</p>
                <p>In early 2022 Mick wrote a Python package called PyLiveATC that allows users to programmatically
                    access LiveATC recordings, download them, and remove the silence from them to make for better
                    listening.</p>
